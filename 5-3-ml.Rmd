### Abstract

The moment the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019 occured people started using machine learning in order to help in managing the situation. Our work is a build up to research described in [@chinese_et_al] and in [@mexican_et_al] articles, we also use the same data in order to create our own models. We improve and create new models predicting COVID-19 mortality based on blood parameters and analyze original models presented in the articles. We train a predicion model with over 70% accuracy calculating risk of getting infected with the virus depending only on person's sex, age and chronic diseases and created an application which calculates the COVID-19 infection risk based on input data and explains the model with visulisations. Considering accuracy of the model, calculations based only on chronic dieases may not achieve best results but we propose an approch which doesnt need any additional medical information, is explainable and easy to understand and requires only data that everyone has access to.
