[["index.html", "Case Studies Preface", " Case Studies 2021-04-02 Preface This book is the result of a student projects for Case Studies course at the Warsaw University of Technology. Each team prepared an article on one of the topics selected from reproducibility, imputation, and interpretability. This project is inspired by a book Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning Methods created at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich XAI Stories. Case studies for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence done at the Warsaw University of Technology and at the University of Warsaw and ML Case Studies during a case study a year ago. We used the LIML project as the cornerstone for this repository. The cover created by Anna Kozak.
